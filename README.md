Tags: translation, polylang, add-on, in-page, shortcode
Requires at least: 3.0
Tested up to: 4.9.6

== Description ==

= What is qPoly =
QPoly add-on allows users to use Polylang similar to how they use qTranslate, by separating different language contexts with shortcodes.

= How to use? =
1. Find parts of a site that can interpret shortcodes, but aren't translatable with the default tools Polylang brings.
E.g. Some theme inputs which strings aren't yet translatable, places where string translations would be too long and messy, and custom page templates used in the Pods plug-in.
2. Use the following shortcode. With the 'lang' attribute you specify the language.
[qpoly lang="es"]string contents[/qlopy]

* 'es' : Spanish

== Changelog ==

= 1.1 =
2017
* Added shortcode functionality for automatic support of all languages
