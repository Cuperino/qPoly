Requires at least: 3.0
Tested up to: 5.0.2

== Description ==

= What is qPoly =
qPoly add-on allows users to use Polylang similar to how the qTranslate plugin works. It is most useful when a theme does not support string translations, and yet you intend on using it. qPoly works by separating different language contents on the same page, using shortcodes. 

= How to use? =
Insert text inside the qPoly shortcode. Use the 'lang' attribute to specify the language using ISO 639-1 codes.
`[qpoly lang="es"]Text content[/qlopy]`

= Compatible languages =
qPoly works with all Polylang supported languages. It accepts 2 character language codes from the ISO 639-1 standard. These can be found at:
* http://xml.coverpages.org/iso639a.html
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes
